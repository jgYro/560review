# How to run jcg.py

Simply run jcg.py and supply two numbers with "a" preferably being a squared number and "b" being anything else. 

## Review of the Math560 library

The documentation was very well put together and there no additional changes needed for the code to easily be put together for something fun to create.

Great job Zach!
